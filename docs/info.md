## How it works

The circuit is a full adder with A,B inpus and sum, cout as outputs which follow the below logic.
    SUM=A ^ B 
    COUT = A &B

| A   | B   | sum | cout |
|-----|-----|-----|------|
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0    |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0    |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1    |

## How to test

Trigger the inputs according to the truth table to observe the output changes.
